// buildSolution.js
// This file demonstrates a solution to the Android build problem.  This solution assumes the problem is a missing dependency.  Replace 'com.example:missing-dependency:1.0.0' with the actual missing dependency and version.

// In your app's android/app/build.gradle file: 
// Add the following line within the dependencies block to resolve the missing dependency:
// implementation 'com.example:missing-dependency:1.0.0'

// ... (rest of your build.gradle file) ...

// If the error relates to dependency conflicts, examine the versions in your dependencies block and resolve conflicts. You might need to use version constraints or exclude specific transitive dependencies.

// Additional solutions may involve:
// 1. Cleaning the project build using ./gradlew clean in the android folder.
// 2. Updating Expo and related packages to their latest versions.
// 3. Carefully reviewing the full error message for more specific guidance.
