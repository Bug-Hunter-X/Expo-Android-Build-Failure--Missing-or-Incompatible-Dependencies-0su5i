This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with an error message related to missing or incompatible dependencies.  The exact error message can vary but often involves missing AAR files or conflicting versions of libraries. This isn't a common error, as it usually points to a misconfiguration in the project's `android` folder or issues with the Android build system itself.
