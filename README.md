# Expo Android Build Failure: Missing or Incompatible Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI's Android build process fails due to missing or incompatible dependencies. The problem stems from issues within the project's `android` configuration, leading to errors during APK generation. This isn't a typical Expo error; rather, it usually highlights misconfigurations in the project's Android setup or problems with the Android build system.  The solution focuses on carefully reviewing and correcting dependency issues and Android configuration settings.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project_directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `expo install`
4. Attempt to build the Android APK: `expo build:android` (This will produce the error.)

## Solution

The solution involves careful examination of the `android` directory and its `build.gradle` files. Possible fixes include:

* **Checking for missing dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies declared in `build.gradle` files are correctly specified and accessible.
* **Resolving dependency conflicts:** Identify and resolve any conflicting versions of libraries by carefully managing dependency versions.
* **Cleaning the build cache:**  Sometimes, a corrupted build cache can cause these errors. Try cleaning it using `./gradlew clean` in the `android` folder.
* **Updating dependencies:** Update your dependencies to the latest versions to potentially resolve compatibility issues.
* **Validating Android Studio project:** Open the project in Android Studio and look for errors or warnings in the IDE; this may offer more detailed clues.
* **Reviewing the error message:** Scrutinize the full error messageâ€”it often provides crucial hints to identify the problematic dependency.
